constructor 
 assign value to the instance variable
byte -128 to 127
Data Type	Size (Bytes)	Size (Bits)	Range / Use
byte	1 byte	8 bits	-128 to 127
short	2 bytes	16 bits	-32,768 to 32,767
char	2 bytes	16 bits	Single Unicode character
int	4 bytes	32 bits	-2³¹ to 2³¹-1
float	4 bytes	32 bits	Decimal (6–7 digits precision)
long	8 bytes	64 bits	-2⁶³ to 2⁶³-1
double	8 bytes	64 bits	Decimal (15–16 digits precision)
boolean	JVM dependent (usually 1 byte)	—	true / false
   

static variable 
 👉 Only one copy of a static variable is created
👉 That single copy is shared by all objects of the class


A Spy Number is a number where:
Sum of its digits = Product of its digits
123


A Strong Number is a number where:
Sum of the factorials of its digits = the number itself
Example 1: 145
Digits → 1, 4, 5
Factorials:
1! = 1
4! = 24
5! = 120
Sum = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145

A final variable in Java is a variable whose value cannot be changed once it is assigned.

A Neon Number is a number where:
Square the number → sum of digits of the square = the number itself
9 is the number
 9*9=81=8+1=9


bitwise operator
Types of Bitwise Operators in Java
Operator	Symbol	Description
AND	&	1 if both bits are 1
OR	`	`
XOR	^	1 if bits are different
NOT	~	Flips all bits (0→1, 1→0)
Left Shift	<<	Shifts bits left, fills with 0
Right Shift	>>	Shifts bits right, preserves sign
Unsigned Right Shift	>>>	Shifts bits right, fills with 0

only based on the binary values
